New GUI theory of operation
---------------------------
   * dg_io (from datacollect) is used to communicate with dataguzzler
   * GTK Widgets (in widgets directory) know about dataguzzler and 
use dg_io to communiate. Create an IO connection with: iohandler=dg_io.io()
   * Widgets can be layed out with Glade. Currently only glade-3.6.7 is 
supported because that is the version with RHEL and it uses gtk2/pygtk2
   * Glade should be in the PATH as "glade-367". It can be run with the
dg_glade command
   * Widgets need to be imported before they can be instantiated. 
dg_gui_gtksupp.import_widgets() finds them all and imports them. 
   * Some widgets may handle values/units, so it's a good idea
to import lm_units and call lm_units.units_config("insert_basic_units")

To instantiate a widget tree, build the tree with glade, then call
   (gladeobjdict,builder)=build_from_file(gladefile)
   dg_gui_initialize_widgets(gladeobjdict,iohandler)

To show a window from the widget tree, use: 
win=gladeobjdict["simpletestwindow"]
win.show()

You then need to run the main loop:  gtk.main()

See simpletest.py for a complete example

Dataguzzler installs dg_glade in /usr/local/bin that has 
access to the dataguzzler widgets. 

Checklists
----------
Code/gladefiles for potential checklist steps are in the "steps/"
directory. Possible steps are:
   * adjustparam:    An adjustable parameter (box on top for adjustment, 
     		     box on bottom for status)
   * burstfreq:      GEN:BURST frequency selection
   * command: 	     A button that issues a command
   * multiparam:     Two separate adjustable parameters
   * sweepfreq:      GEN:SWEEP frequency selection
   * text:           Simple textual instructions

Sample checklists are in the checklists/ directory.
Sample checklist entry: 
check "This is a step" text,
      description="This is the step instruction"
      . 

The entry starts with the word "check", then the quoted title of the
step. Then a space and the step type (i.e. text, adjustparam, etc), then
a comma and the first parameter=value setting. Values may be quoted 
strings, floating points, or integers followed by the letter 'i' (e.g. 5i).
Each parameter=value pair should end with a comma, except the last
which should either end with a period or a colon. If a colon, a Python
block (indented at least two spaces) may follow, that is to be executed

(this feature -- executing Python code -- is still in development and
has not been tested. In the future it should be possible to trigger it 
by various means). 



For Windows version: (untested)
Install Anaconda Python 2.7 version 32 BIT.
Get latest pygtk all-in-one package from www.pygtk.org
Install Anaconda . Then install PyGTK into Anaconda's environment
Then run python setup.py install in Anaconda's environment
