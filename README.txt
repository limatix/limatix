About LIMATIX
------------------

LIMATIX is a collection of tools for performing and recording
scientific experiments, based on the twin ideas of checklists and
experiment logs.  It does not address the problem of data acquisition
per se -- it assumes you have another software package handling
that. Instead, it addresses the parallel problems of keeping track of
procedures, recording which procedures were performed (checklists),
and keeping a log (like a laboratory notebook) of the progress of an
experiment. It also includes a tool (processtrak) to assist in
organizing and executing processing tasks.



Programs
--------
datacollect2 -- Main program for performing checklist-based experiment logging
dc_checklist -- Main program for standalone checklists and plans
dc_chx2chf -- create a filled checklist file from an unfilled .chx file
dc_getpath -- get the path to the datacollect2 installation
dc_glade   -- run the glade 3.6.7 user interface builder to create custom
              GUI interfaces
dc_gui     -- Run a custom GUI interface created with dc_glade
dc_paramdb2 -- Run a parameter database server with a simple tabular GUI
processtrak -- command line tool for controlling postprocessing steps
pt_checkprovenance -- Tool to check provenance status of processed experiment
                      logs
dc_ricohphoto -- Tool to use Ricoh WiFi camera to capture pictures of
                 and experiment
dc_xlg2dpd -- tool to extract a datacollect parameter dump (.dpd file) from
              an experiment log (OBSOLETE)
thermal2limatix -- Tool to convert obsolete XML namespaces to the new
                   limatix namespaces
limatix-git -- Tool for automating committing raw data and scripts into main branch and processed output also into processed branches.

Primary libraries in the limatix package
----------------------------------------
dc_value     -- value classes that support units and serialize to XML
xmldoc       -- representation of an XML document such as an experiment log,
                with routines to add and extract data.
provenance   -- Provenance tracking within XML documents
paramdb2     -- Database of parameters to be written to experiment log
