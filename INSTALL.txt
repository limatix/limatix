
Prerequisites:
  python (version 3.8 or later)
  python-lxml (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  numpy (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  pytz (Python timezone library; sometimes listed as 'python-tz')
  gtk3 and python bindings (on python3;  required to use datacollect2 GUI components)
  setuptools (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  setuptools_scm
  platformdirs
  pint (optional, for advanced units support)


Recommended:
  python-pillow (required for Ricoh camera support and for representing parameters that are images)
  limatix-qautils (not used directly, but documents checklist
         	   format/structure and can render checklists as PDF)
  ipython (with PySide/PySide2/PyQt4/PyQt5 QT bindings) for interactive debugging of processtrak scripts
  ipykernel for ipython interactive debugging
  matplotlib (with QT4 and/or QT5 support) for use with ipython for interactive
             debugging of processtrak scripts

Limatix should work on all major platforms with the above packages.
In most cases you will want to use a package manager or a Python
distribution such as Canopy or Anaconda to provide the packages. 
Detailed installation instructions for Windows are included below. 

Limatix is built with Python setuptools:


To install into Python site-packages (as root)
  pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation .


Windows installation instructions
---------------------------------
For processtrak, pip install as above.

Prerequisites:
  pywin32

For datacollect2, TBD


Running datacollect2 on Windows under Python3
---------------------------------------------
datacollect2 under Python3 requires Gtk3 and PyGObject, which have
traditionally been hard to obtain for Windows. You may have luck
installing PyGObject through MSYS2(https://www.msys2.org/) or with
Anaconda via conda-forge.  This has not been rigorously tested.



Getting Started
