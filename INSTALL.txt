
Prerequisites:
  python (version 2.7 or 3.x)
  python-lxml (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  numpy (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  pytz (Python timezone library; sometimes listed as 'python-tz')
  gtk2 and pygtk2 (on python2;  required to use datacollect2 GUI components)
  gtk3 and python bindings (on python3;  required to use datacollect2 GUI components)
  setuptools (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  pint (required for units support)


Recommended:
  python-pillow (required for Ricoh camera support and for representing parameters that are images)
  glade-3.6.7 (required for interactive gtk2 widget layout; not needed for
               general use)
  limatix-qautils (not used directly, but documents checklist
         	   format/structure and can render checklists as PDF)
  ipython (with PySide/PySide2/PyQt4/PyQt5 QT bindings) (version 7.10.0 tested and working on windows) 
               for interactive debugging of processtrak scripts
  ipykernel (version >=5.2.0 required on windows) for ipython interactive debugging
  matplotlib (with QT4 and/or QT5 support) for use with ipython for interactive
             debugging of processtrak scripts

Limatix should work on all major platforms with the above packages.
In most cases you will want to use a package manager or a Python
distribution such as Canopy or Anaconda to provide the packages. 
Detailed installation instructions for Windows are included below. 

Limatix is built with Python setuptools:

To build from source package, from terminal or command prompt:
  python setup.py build

To install into Python site-packages (as root)
  python setup.py install
  python setup.py install_data

Note that the install_data step also installs some useful files
into $(PREFIX)/share/limatix where $(PREFIX) is the Python
installation prefix. These include sample checklists, configuration
files, documentation, and processtrak steps.



Windows installation instructions
---------------------------------
FOR DATACOLLECT2 USE A 32-BIT PYTHON 2.7 INSTALLATAION
1. Install Anaconda Python 2.7 version 32 bit or Enthought
   Canopy 32 bit. http://www.continuum.io or 
   http://www.enthought.com
2. Get latest pygtk all-in-one package from www.pygtk.org
3. Install PyGTK Python 2.7 all-in-one, making sure it 
   installs into the Anaconda or Canopy distribution from 
   above. 
4. Open an Anaconda or Canopy command prompt, change to 
   your Limatix source tree directory, then run:
     python setup.py install
     python setup.py install_data
   This will install Limatix into your Anaconda or Canopy
   installation
5. From an Anaconda or Canopy command prompt you should 
   now be able to run 'datacollect2', 'processtrak', etc.
6. Also obtain a good XML editor that supports syntax
   highlighting to associate with the various Limatix XML
   file types.

A note on 32-bit vs. 64-bit on Windows
--------------------------------------
Datacollect2 on Windows is best tested in Python 2.7/GTK 2.x. 
PyGTK 2.x is only available for 32 bit Windows, hence install
a 32-bit Python version. 

Limatix will work fine on 64 bit Python, but on Windows 
that means you will need to use GTK3 (see below).
GTK3 support has not been extensively tested especially on
Windows and is missing some key functionality such as 
colored widgets. 

ProcessTrak does not require GTK and will work fine
on 64 bit Python

Running datacollect2 on Windows under Python3
---------------------------------------------
datacollect2 under Python3 requires Gtk3 and PyGObject, which have
traditionally been hard to obtain for Windows. You may have luck
installing PyGObject through MSYS2(https://www.msys2.org/) or with
Anaconda via conda-forge.  This has not been rigorously tested.



Getting Started
---------------
See doc/LIMATIX.xhtml for quickstart documentation and
examples. 

Troubleshooting
---------------
If you run into errors in finding canonicalize_path and/or
dc_lxml_treesync, that means you used an incomplete download.
The Limatix repository includes these sub-repositories.
When downloading from Github, always download the
"limatix-<VERSION>.tar.gz" or "limatix-<VERSION>.zip"
rather than the Github-generated "source code" archives,
as the latter do not include the sub-repositories

see README.txt for basic information on LIMATIX
