Prerequisites:
  python (version 2.7 or 3.x... 3.x is a bit of a work in progress)
  python-lxml (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  numpy (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  gtk2 and pygtk2 (on python2;  required to use GUI components)
  gtk3 and python bindings (on python3;  required to use GUI components)
  setuptools (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  dataguzzler-lib


Recommended:
  python-pillow (required for Ricoh camera support and for representing parameters that are images)
  glade-3.6.7 (required for interative gtk2 widget layout; not needed for
               general use)
  datacollect2-qautils (not used directly, but documents checklist
                        format/structure and can render checklists as PDF)
  ipython (with PySide qt4 bindings) for interactive debugging of 
          dcprocess scripts
  matplotlib (with qt4 support) for use with ipython for interactive
             debugging of dcprocess scripts

datacollect2 is built with Python setuptools. 

To build from source package:
  python setup.py build

To install into Python site-packages 
  python setup.py install
  python setup.py install_data

Note that the install_data step also installs some useful files
into $(PREFIX)/share/datacollect2 where $(PREFIX) is the Python
installation prefix. These include sample checklists, configuration
files, documentation, and dc_process steps.
