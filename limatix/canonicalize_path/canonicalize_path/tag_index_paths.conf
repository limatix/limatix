    # The key (element) is specified with its namespace in Clark notation.
    # The value is a relative Clark-notation xpath that is 
    # convertable to a string (note: if an element is provided 
    # the first text node may be all that is used)
    # If a list or tuple is provided then the entries will be tried in order
    # until one doesn't come up empty.
